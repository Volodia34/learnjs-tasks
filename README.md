# LearnJS Tasks

This repository contains my solutions to tasks from the [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info) tutorial (also known as LearnJS).

## 📚 About

[JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info) is a modern tutorial that covers the JavaScript language from the basics to advanced topics.

I created this repository to:
- Practice JavaScript by solving real exercises
- Track my progress through the tutorial
- Review and improve my code over time

## 🧩 Structure

Each topic or section has its own folder. Inside each folder, you'll find:
- `task.js` – the original task (or my interpretation of it)
- `solution.js` – my solution to the task
- `README.md` – a short description of the task (optional)

Example:

learnjs-tasks/
├── 01-variables/
│ ├── task.js
│ ├── solution.js
│ └── README.md
├── 02-functions/
│ └── ...


## 🚀 How to Use

You can explore each folder to see how I approached the tasks. Feel free to fork the repo and try solving the exercises yourself!

## ✅ Progress

> I'll keep updating this repo as I go through the tutorial.

## 📌 Note

This is a personal learning project. The solutions might not always be the most optimal — feedback and suggestions are welcome!
