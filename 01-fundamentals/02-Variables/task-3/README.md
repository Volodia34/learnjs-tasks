# Task: Uppercase const?

### 📝 Task Details

* **Original Task:** [Uppercase const?](https://learn.javascript.info/variables#uppercase-const)
* **Importance:** 4

> Examine the following code:
>
> ```javascript
> const birthday = '18.04.1982';
> const age = someCode(birthday);
> ```
>
> Here we have a constant `birthday` for the date, and also the `age` constant. The `age` is calculated from `birthday` using `someCode()`.
>
> Would it be right to use upper case for `birthday`? For `age`? Or even for both?
